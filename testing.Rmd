## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r questions, echo=FALSE}
library(questionr)
library(learnr)
```

```{r letter-a, echo=FALSE}

    question("What number is the letter A in the English alphabet?",
      answer("8"),
      answer("14"),
      answer("1", correct = TRUE),
      answer("23"),
      random_answer_order = TRUE
    )
```
